# Geographic-Prediction-System-for-Music-Clips

In this project we are going to teach the machine how to listen to a music and identify the music origin. For this purpose, 959 music
clips have been collected from various parts of planet. From each music clip 116 sound synthesis quantities have been extracted and are reported along with the origin of the music clip (the coordinate of the city of the origin).

The input features of the aforementioned data are:

Var1-Var116 Which are technically sound and wave synthesis features extracted from
each music clip. No information is available about the nature of these features and
their extraction involves a complex process.

The response variables are:

latitude: which is the latitude of the city the music originates from. Note that the
numbers are presented in a different setup than the standard geographical coordinates.

longitude: which is the longitude of the city the music originates from. Note that the
numbers are presented in a different setup than the standard geographical coordinates.
